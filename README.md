# Lx200ClassicHandset
Handset Project for Meade LX200 Classic Telescope

This is a project to create a replacement handset for the Meade LX200 Classic Telescope
The handset needs to provide an initalisation string back to the base, before serial communications can take place, this project uses a ESP32 based Arduino procesessor with built in OLED display to communicate and display details from the LX200 Classic base unit.

The first implementation uses wifi and Blynk.cc mobile application to simulate the handset on a smartphone and provide 95% functionality of the original handset.
