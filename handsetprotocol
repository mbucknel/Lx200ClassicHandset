The Handset communications protocol is serial 9600,n,8,1 - Note the signal is inverted, so if you want to sniff the transmission, 
the best method is with a FTDI usb / serial port and use the FTDI utility to invert the Tx & Rx
Use Realterm and you can view the hex or ascii or for some sequences below, i have both

The LX200 Classic needs an initalisation code from the handset to complete its boot up sequence
The init sequence is :- 
FF FF FF FF FF 2A

The initial sequence is :-
F0  1B 131  20  20  20  20 L4C X58 232 030 030 /2F 232  1B 232  20  20 V56 e65

 20 L4C I49 B42 R52 A41 R52 Y59  20  1B 131 ~7E
 
1B = start of a line / sequence / command
~ (7E) is the -> char on the display

Basics :-
a sequence for each line (2 x 16 LCD) is sent starting with 1B, the 2nd char denotes the line number (31 = 1 or 32 = 2) and then the
digits to be displayed are sent
if there is a selection (using next / prev buttons) then a 3rd line is sent with the line number of the selection and the -> char (~ = 7E)
so for the first display

1 TELESCOPE      2 OBJECT LIBRARY 1~ 

The Hex sequence is
1B312054454C4553434F5045202020202020
1B32204F424A454354204C49425241525920
1B317E

As you can see the lines start with 1B, the 2nd char 31 or 32 denotes line number and the rest is the ascii text

The only difference is when there is inputs Eg you press the M key and it asks for an input, when you type the digits, they are just displayed
until you press enter

There are a number of special functions to control other things like the movement speed, ALT led and clearing the screen

CM object:PPDLS
1B 43(C) denotes a special function, usually M, Star or CNGC lookup and the the line is displayed on Line 1
the rest sets a flashing cursor on line 2 and waits for an input

1B 42(B) is a clear screen command
1B 44(D) followed by 00 or 01 sets the ALT LED on or off
1B 4C(L) followed by 08, 04, 02 or 01 sets slew speed LED's 08 being the top led and fastest slew speed


For Ardunino strings, the low char values 00-08 cause issues in strings, so some special code handling was needed to handle these

For sending handset codes, each button sends 2 values, one on make and another on break

for Enter 0D is sent on the key down and then 8D on the key up

The codes are here http://www.lx200classic.com/files/Meade%20LX200%20Classic%20Hand%20Controller%20Key%20Codes.pdf
(Note there is a couple of errors on W key, the up is listed as B7 and it should be D7, S is listed as C3 and it should be D3)
